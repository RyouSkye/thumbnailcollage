<h1>Thumbnail Collage Generator</h1>
<p>This is a tool made using Javascript with the purpose of adding some thumbnails together and making a collage out of them.</p>
<p>Optionally each entry can also be labeled. If you would like to use your settings again in the future, but with different files, you can download the configuration as a text file and load it.</p>
<p>The result will be rendered as an image file and inserted into the page, but you can also directly download it. Have fun :D</p>
